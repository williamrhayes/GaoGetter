Booz Allen Hamilton is a consulting company that earns most of its revenue through government contracts. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) contains reports that include tables with data about why some companies win government contracts win and others lose. In this analysis, I used Scrapy to extract this data from gao.gov and used XGBoost to predict whether a company would win or lose a government contract based on its scores in a few key areas. This analysis was the capstone of my Data Science Fundamentals course for General Assembly.

The composite dataset is too large to be featured so the cleaned subset is included instead.
